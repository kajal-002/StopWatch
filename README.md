Stopwatch Web Application<br>
<br>
Description:<br>
<br>
This repository contains files for a simple stopwatch web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to track elapsed time with precision and provides basic controls for starting, stopping, and resetting the stopwatch.<br>

The HTML file (index.html) defines the structure of the web page, featuring a display area for the stopwatch time and buttons for controlling its functionality. CSS styling (style.css) is applied to enhance the visual appeal of the interface, including background images and button styling, providing an engaging user experience.<br>

The core functionality of the stopwatch is implemented in JavaScript (script.js). The script initializes variables for tracking hours, minutes, and seconds, and provides functions to start, stop, and reset the stopwatch. The timer logic ensures accurate timekeeping and updates the display dynamically.<br>

This project serves as a foundational example for building stopwatch functionality in web applications. Developers can explore and customize the code to incorporate additional features or integrate it into larger projects as needed.<br>
